Asynchronous Use Cases:
    Partial Refresh of Page
    Partial Loading of Page
    Validation (server)
        eg. username clash

Chat
    Can be either P2P or via server (polling - bad)
        Solution: Don't poll, server will push notifications (server push, reverse AJAX or COMET)

Formats in which we will usually send async response:
    Plain text - good, light weight - but can't use for structured data
    JSON - very good for structure - auto maps to JS object
        eg.
        {
            "empId" : 119,
            "name"  : "Ramu"
        }
        obj.name
    XML - Can attach semantics to the tag contents
        eg.
            <label>Name:Ramu</label> <!-- Would need splitting -->
        But with XML, we can use
            <employeeName>Ramu</employeeName>
    HTML - too many characters, placeholders are already there hence we try to avoid

JSON vs XML
    Filters in JSON, need to be implemented by iterating over the elements and then creating HTML elements dynamically
    But XSLT(eXtended Style ########) allows us to, given a set of rules, auto convert XML to HTML statements.

Example:
    Username validation in registration form
        Have a hidden iframe which will make a request to the server.
            Iframe has parent child relation with the page and hence we can do
                parent.functionCall()
        The server returns some script that gets executed.

How to send POST request via iframe
    Add name attribute to iframe
    Add target attribute to the form

When we hit the back button, we don't go to some other page
    The iframe history is maintained :D

Good:
    GET & POST
    History
    Easy to code
Bad:
    No error handling
