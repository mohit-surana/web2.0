=========================================================================
The exercise for the 2nd Program. This one is on Multi-stage download.
(We will discuss in class in detail. The idea is straight-forward)

The problem statement is as follows.

A book-search web page served by localhost is rich in content and GUI. 
It has multiple images to display, a search form for the front-end user 
to search for a book, a set of links which might interest the user and 
also general information on how to use the site. Use Multi-stage download 
pattern to demonstrate good user experience with this page. On entering an 
ISBN in the search box and searching for it, return the matching book from the 
server. The server can maintain book information in a text file.

Notes:

1. When you search for the book for an ISBN, no need to read the database
   or files. You can hardcode book details for around 5 ISBNs and return them
   to the client as search results.
   
   For instance, you can return "C_Programming;K&R;Prentice Hall;200" 
   for ISBN = "102200111" (some random number)
   
2. The entire page will download in multiple stages. 
   The content will not come at once. (Why??).
   The text content (information about how to use the site) will load first.(Why??) 
   
3. You can provide a time gap of around 3 seconds before you download 
   the next content. You have to decide whether you will download the links
   or images (logo etc) or the search box with the button.
   
4. The hyperlinks (around 4 of them) will be links to library sites of 
   individual departments. (You can provide static html pages for each 
   of these links, each page displaying some default text)
   
5. After the entire download, the page looks as shown in the attached jpeg.

6. As you make the user wait for more content, you must have place holders
   (possibly <div> elements) which have a "gif" file to convey that more 
   information is coming. Use the attached gif file. As soon as the initial
   download is over, the gif will be placed in 3 places (for the images, the links
   and the search box)
   
7. Each download is accomplished by an AJAX call. Use XHR technique.
   The image can be downloaded using image-based AJAX.
   
8. The book search functionality is also asynchronous and the results are
   appended as an unordered list at the end of the current page. A new search
   will remove the current list and add a new one in its place.
   
9. The hyperlinks can be stored as a combination of innerHTML and hrefs in 
   a file on the server. 
   
   Ex:
   The file can be named links.text and can have the following content:
   CSE;http://www.cs.pes.edu
   ECE;http://www.ec.pes.edu
   EEE;http://www.eee.pesit.edu
   
   Now download the file entirely(without reading it on the server).
   When opening a connection using XHR, use the following line.
   
   xhr.open("GET", "http://localhost/links.txt",true);
   
   The xhr.responseText will have the entire file contents.
   
   Thus the files required to execute this exercise are:
   
   1) A client side HTML5 file (which has the initial content and also the
      AJAX code to do the Multi-stage download)
	  
   2) A text file on the server which has the hrefs' info (see point 9 above)
   
   3) A server side script to execute the search functionality.
   
   4) Images and the gif (see attached along with this instructions file)
   
   5) Static HTML pages for each of the hyperlinks.

      AJAX code to do the Multi-stage download)
	  
   2) A text file on the server which has the hrefs' info (see point 9 above)
   
   3) A server side script to execute the search functionality.
   
   4) Images and the gif (see attached along with this instructions file)
   
   5) Static HTML pages for each of the hyperlinks.
   
   The exercise for the 2nd Program. This one is on Multi-stage download.
(We will discuss in class in detail. The idea is straight-forward)

The problem statement is as follows.

A book-search web page served by localhost is rich in content and GUI. 
It has multiple images to display, a search form for the front-end user 
to search for a book, a set of links which might interest the user and 
also general information on how to use the site. Use Multi-stage download 
pattern to demonstrate good user experience with this page. On entering an 
ISBN in the search box and searching for it, return the matching book from the 
server. The server can maintain book information in a text file.

Notes:

1. When you search for the book for an ISBN, no need to read the database
   or files. You can hardcode book details for around 5 ISBNs and return them
   to the client as search results.
   
   For instance, you can return "C_Programming;K&R;Prentice Hall;200" 
   for ISBN = "102200111" (some random number)
   
2. The entire page will download in multiple stages. 
   The content will not come at once. (Why??).
   The text content (information about how to use the site) will load first.(Why??) 
   
3. You can provide a time gap of around 3 seconds before you download 
   the next content. You have to decide whether you will download the links
   or images (logo etc) or the search box with the button.
   
4. The hyperlinks (around 4 of them) will be links to library sites of 
   individual departments. (You can provide static html pages for each 
   of these links, each page displaying some default text)
   
5. After the entire download, the page looks as shown in the attached jpeg.

6. As you make the user wait for more content, you must have place holders
   (possibly <div> elements) which have a "gif" file to convey that more 
   information is coming. Use the attached gif file. As soon as the initial
   download is over, the gif will be placed in 3 places (for the images, the links
   and the search box)
   
7. Each download is accomplished by an AJAX call. Use XHR technique.
   The image can be downloaded using image-based AJAX.
   
8. The book search functionality is also asynchronous and the results are
   appended as an unordered list at the end of the current page. A new search
   will remove the current list and add a new one in its place.
   
9. The hyperlinks can be stored as a combination of innerHTML and hrefs in 
   a file on the server. 
   
   Ex:
   The file can be named links.text and can have the following content:
   CSE;http://www.cs.pes.edu
   ECE;http://www.ec.pes.edu
   EEE;http://www.eee.pesit.edu
   
   Now download the file entirely(without reading it on the server).
   When opening a connection using XHR, use the following line.
   
   xhr.open("GET", "http://localhost/links.txt",true);
   
   The xhr.responseText will have the entire file contents.
   
   Thus the files required to execute this exercise are:
   
   1) A client side HTML5 file (which has the initial content and also the
      AJAX code to do the Multi-stage download)
	  
   2) A text file on the server which has the hrefs' info (see point 9 above)
   
   3) A server side script to execute the search functionality.

   ECE;http://www.ec.pes.edu
   EEE;http://www.eee.pesit.edu
   
   Now download the file entirely(without reading it on the server).
   When opening a connection using XHR, use the following line.
   
   xhr.open("GET", "http://localhost/links.txt",true);
   
   The xhr.responseText will have the entire file contents.
   
   Thus the files required to execute this exercise are:
   
   1) A client side HTML5 file (which has the initial content and also the
      AJAX code to do the Multi-stage download)
	  
   2) A text file on the server which has the hrefs' info (see point 9 above)
   
   3) A server side script to execute the search functionality.
   
   4) Images and the gif (see attached along with this instructions file)
   
   5) Static HTML pages for each of the hyperlinks.
   
   
   The exercise for the 2nd Program. This one is on Multi-stage download.
(We will discuss in class in detail. The idea is straight-forward)

The problem statement is as follows.

A book-search web page served by localhost is rich in content and GUI. 
It has multiple images to display, a search form for the front-end user 
to search for a book, a set of links which might interest the user and 
also general information on how to use the site. Use Multi-stage download 
pattern to demonstrate good user experience with this page. On entering an 
ISBN in the search box and searching for it, return the matching book from the 
server. The server can maintain book information in a text file.

Notes:

1. When you search for the book for an ISBN, no need to read the database
   or files. You can hardcode book details for around 5 ISBNs and return them
   to the client as search results.
   
   For instance, you can return "C_Programming;K&R;Prentice Hall;200" 
   for ISBN = "102200111" (some random number)
   
2. The entire page will download in multiple stages. 
   The content will not come at once. (Why??).
   The text content (information about how to use the site) will load first.(Why??) 
   
3. You can provide a time gap of around 3 seconds before you download 
   the next content. You have to decide whether you will download the links
   or images (logo etc) or the search box with the button.
   
4. The hyperlinks (around 4 of them) will be links to library sites of 
   individual departments. (You can provide static html pages for each 
   of these links, each page displaying some default text)
   
5. After the entire download, the page looks as shown in the attached jpeg.

6. As you make the user wait for more content, you must have place holders
   (possibly <div> elements) which have a "gif" file to convey that more 
   information is coming. Use the attached gif file. As soon as the initial
   download is over, the gif will be placed in 3 places (for the images, the links
   and the search box)
   
7. Each download is accomplished by an AJAX call. Use XHR technique.
   The image can be downloaded using image-based AJAX.
   
8. The book search functionality is also asynchronous and the results are
   appended as an unordered list at the end of the current page. A new search
   will remove the current list and add a new one in its place.
   
9. The hyperlinks can be stored as a combination of innerHTML and hrefs in 
   a file on the server. 
   
   Ex:
   The file can be named links.text and can have the following content:
   CSE;http://www.cs.pes.edu
   ECE;http://www.ec.pes.edu
   EEE;http://www.eee.pesit.edu
   
   Now download the file entirely(without reading it on the server).
   When opening a connection using XHR, use the following line.

   The image can be downloaded using image-based AJAX.
   
8. The book search functionality is also asynchronous and the results are
   appended as an unordered list at the end of the current page. A new search
   will remove the current list and add a new one in its place.
   
9. The hyperlinks can be stored as a combination of innerHTML and hrefs in 
   a file on the server. 
   
   Ex:
   The file can be named links.text and can have the following content:
   CSE;http://www.cs.pes.edu
   ECE;http://www.ec.pes.edu
   EEE;http://www.eee.pesit.edu
   
   Now download the file entirely(without reading it on the server).
   When opening a connection using XHR, use the following line.
   
   xhr.open("GET", "http://localhost/links.txt",true);
   
   The xhr.responseText will have the entire file contents.
   
   Thus the files required to execute this exercise are:
   
   1) A client side HTML5 file (which has the initial content and also the
      AJAX code to do the Multi-stage download)
	  
   2) A text file on the server which has the hrefs' info (see point 9 above)
   
   3) A server side script to execute the search functionality.
   
   4) Images and the gif (see attached along with this instructions file)
   
   5) Static HTML pages for each of the hyperlinks.
   
   The exercise for the 2nd Program. This one is on Multi-stage download.
(We will discuss in class in detail. The idea is straight-forward)

The problem statement is as follows.

A book-search web page served by localhost is rich in content and GUI. 
It has multiple images to display, a search form for the front-end user 
to search for a book, a set of links which might interest the user and 
also general information on how to use the site. Use Multi-stage download 
pattern to demonstrate good user experience with this page. On entering an 
ISBN in the search box and searching for it, return the matching book from the 
server. The server can maintain book information in a text file.

Notes:

1. When you search for the book for an ISBN, no need to read the database
   or files. You can hardcode book details for around 5 ISBNs and return them
   to the client as search results.
   
   For instance, you can return "C_Programming;K&R;Prentice Hall;200" 
   for ISBN = "102200111" (some random number)
   
2. The entire page will download in multiple stages. 
   The content will not come at once. (Why??).
   The text content (information about how to use the site) will load first.(Why??) 
   
3. You can provide a time gap of around 3 seconds before you download 
   the next content. You have to decide whether you will download the links
   or images (logo etc) or the search box with the button.
   
4. The hyperlinks (around 4 of them) will be links to library sites of 
   individual departments. (You can provide static html pages for each 
   of these links, each page displaying some default text)
   
5. After the entire download, the page looks as shown in the attached jpeg.

6. As you make the user wait for more content, you must have place holders
   (possibly <div> elements) which have a "gif" file to convey that more 
   information is coming. Use the attached gif file. As soon as the initial
   download is over, the gif will be placed in 3 places (for the images, the links
   and the search box)
   
7. Each download is accomplished by an AJAX call. Use XHR technique.
   The image can be downloaded using image-based AJAX.
   
8. The book search functionality is also asynchronous and the results are

5. After the entire download, the page looks as shown in the attached jpeg.

6. As you make the user wait for more content, you must have place holders
   (possibly <div> elements) which have a "gif" file to convey that more 
   information is coming. Use the attached gif file. As soon as the initial
   download is over, the gif will be placed in 3 places (for the images, the links
   and the search box)
   
7. Each download is accomplished by an AJAX call. Use XHR technique.
   The image can be downloaded using image-based AJAX.
   
8. The book search functionality is also asynchronous and the results are
   appended as an unordered list at the end of the current page. A new search
   will remove the current list and add a new one in its place.
   
9. The hyperlinks can be stored as a combination of innerHTML and hrefs in 
   a file on the server. 
   
   Ex:
   The file can be named links.text and can have the following content:
   CSE;http://www.cs.pes.edu
   ECE;http://www.ec.pes.edu
   EEE;http://www.eee.pesit.edu
   
   Now download the file entirely(without reading it on the server).
   When opening a connection using XHR, use the following line.
   
   xhr.open("GET", "http://localhost/links.txt",true);
   
   The xhr.responseText will have the entire file contents.
   
   Thus the files required to execute this exercise are:
   
   1) A client side HTML5 file (which has the initial content and also the
      AJAX code to do the Multi-stage download)
	  
   2) A text file on the server which has the hrefs' info (see point 9 above)
   
   3) A server side script to execute the search functionality.
   
   4) Images and the gif (see attached along with this instructions file)
   
   5) Static HTML pages for each of the hyperlinks.
   
   
   The exercise for the 2nd Program. This one is on Multi-stage download.
(We will discuss in class in detail. The idea is straight-forward)

The problem statement is as follows.

A book-search web page served by localhost is rich in content and GUI. 
It has multiple images to display, a search form for the front-end user 
to search for a book, a set of links which might interest the user and 
also general information on how to use the site. Use Multi-stage download 
pattern to demonstrate good user experience with this page. On entering an 
ISBN in the search box and searching for it, return the matching book from the 
server. The server can maintain book information in a text file.

Notes:

1. When you search for the book for an ISBN, no need to read the database
   or files. You can hardcode book details for around 5 ISBNs and return them
   to the client as search results.
   
   For instance, you can return "C_Programming;K&R;Prentice Hall;200" 
   for ISBN = "102200111" (some random number)
   
2. The entire page will download in multiple stages. 
   The content will not come at once. (Why??).
   The text content (information about how to use the site) will load first.(Why??) 
   
3. You can provide a time gap of around 3 seconds before you download 
   the next content. You have to decide whether you will download the links
   or images (logo etc) or the search box with the button.
   
4. The hyperlinks (around 4 of them) will be links to library sites of 
   individual departments. (You can provide static html pages for each 
   of these links, each page displaying some default text)
   
5. After the entire download, the page looks as shown in the attached jpeg.

6. As you make the user wait for more content, you must have place holders

   The text content (information about how to use the site) will load first.(Why??) 
   
3. You can provide a time gap of around 3 seconds before you download 
   the next content. You have to decide whether you will download the links
   or images (logo etc) or the search box with the button.
   
4. The hyperlinks (around 4 of them) will be links to library sites of 
   individual departments. (You can provide static html pages for each 
   of these links, each page displaying some default text)
   
5. After the entire download, the page looks as shown in the attached jpeg.

6. As you make the user wait for more content, you must have place holders
   (possibly <div> elements) which have a "gif" file to convey that more 
   information is coming. Use the attached gif file. As soon as the initial
   download is over, the gif will be placed in 3 places (for the images, the links
   and the search box)
   
7. Each download is accomplished by an AJAX call. Use XHR technique.
   The image can be downloaded using image-based AJAX.
   
8. The book search functionality is also asynchronous and the results are
   appended as an unordered list at the end of the current page. A new search
   will remove the current list and add a new one in its place.
   
9. The hyperlinks can be stored as a combination of innerHTML and hrefs in 
   a file on the server. 
   
   Ex:
   The file can be named links.text and can have the following content:
   CSE;http://www.cs.pes.edu
   ECE;http://www.ec.pes.edu
   EEE;http://www.eee.pesit.edu
   
   Now download the file entirely(without reading it on the server).
   When opening a connection using XHR, use the following line.
   
   xhr.open("GET", "http://localhost/links.txt",true);
   
   The xhr.responseText will have the entire file contents.
   
   Thus the files required to execute this exercise are:
   
   1) A client side HTML5 file (which has the initial content and also the
      AJAX code to do the Multi-stage download)
	  
   2) A text file on the server which has the hrefs' info (see point 9 above)
   
   3) A server side script to execute the search functionality.
   
   4) Images and the gif (see attached along with this instructions file)
   
   5) Static HTML pages for each of the hyperlinks.
   
   The exercise for the 2nd Program. This one is on Multi-stage download.
(We will discuss in class in detail. The idea is straight-forward)

The problem statement is as follows.

A book-search web page served by localhost is rich in content and GUI. 
It has multiple images to display, a search form for the front-end user 
to search for a book, a set of links which might interest the user and 
also general information on how to use the site. Use Multi-stage download 
pattern to demonstrate good user experience with this page. On entering an 
ISBN in the search box and searching for it, return the matching book from the 
server. The server can maintain book information in a text file.

Notes:

1. When you search for the book for an ISBN, no need to read the database
   or files. You can hardcode book details for around 5 ISBNs and return them
   to the client as search results.
   
   For instance, you can return "C_Programming;K&R;Prentice Hall;200" 
   for ISBN = "102200111" (some random number)

1. When you search for the book for an ISBN, no need to read the database
   or files. You can hardcode book details for around 5 ISBNs and return them
   to the client as search results.
   
   For instance, you can return "C_Programming;K&R;Prentice Hall;200" 
   for ISBN = "102200111" (some random number)
   
2. The entire page will download in multiple stages. 
   The content will not come at once. (Why??).
   The text content (information about how to use the site) will load first.(Why??) 
   
3. You can provide a time gap of around 3 seconds before you download 
   the next content. You have to decide whether you will download the links
   or images (logo etc) or the search box with the button.
   
4. The hyperlinks (around 4 of them) will be links to library sites of 
   individual departments. (You can provide static html pages for each 
   of these links, each page displaying some default text)
   
5. After the entire download, the page looks as shown in the attached jpeg.

6. As you make the user wait for more content, you must have place holders
   (possibly <div> elements) which have a "gif" file to convey that more 
   information is coming. Use the attached gif file. As soon as the initial
   download is over, the gif will be placed in 3 places (for the images, the links
   and the search box)
   
7. Each download is accomplished by an AJAX call. Use XHR technique.
   The image can be downloaded using image-based AJAX.
   
8. The book search functionality is also asynchronous and the results are
   appended as an unordered list at the end of the current page. A new search
   will remove the current list and add a new one in its place.
   
9. The hyperlinks can be stored as a combination of innerHTML and hrefs in 
   a file on the server. 
   
   Ex:
   The file can be named links.text and can have the following content:
   CSE;http://www.cs.pes.edu
   ECE;http://www.ec.pes.edu
   EEE;http://www.eee.pesit.edu
   
   Now download the file entirely(without reading it on the server).
   When opening a connection using XHR, use the following line.
   
   xhr.open("GET", "http://localhost/links.txt",true);
   
   The xhr.responseText will have the entire file contents.
   
   Thus the files required to execute this exercise are:
   
   1) A client side HTML5 file (which has the initial content and also the
      AJAX code to do the Multi-stage download)
	  
   2) A text file on the server which has the hrefs' info (see point 9 above)
   
   3) A server side script to execute the search functionality.
   
   4) Images and the gif (see attached along with this instructions file)
   
   5) Static HTML pages for each of the hyperlinks.The exercise for the 2nd Program. This one is on Multi-stage download.
(We will discuss in class in detail. The idea is straight-forward)

The problem statement is as follows.

A book-search web page served by localhost is rich in content and GUI. 
It has multiple images to display, a search form for the front-end user 
to search for a book, a set of links which might interest the user and 
also general information on how to use the site. Use Multi-stage download 
pattern to demonstrate good user experience with this page. On entering an 
ISBN in the search box and searching for it, return the matching book from the 
server. The server can maintain book information in a text file.

A book-search web page served by localhost is rich in content and GUI. 
It has multiple images to display, a search form for the front-end user 
to search for a book, a set of links which might interest the user and 
also general information on how to use the site. Use Multi-stage download 
pattern to demonstrate good user experience with this page. On entering an 
ISBN in the search box and searching for it, return the matching book from the 
server. The server can maintain book information in a text file.

Notes:

1. When you search for the book for an ISBN, no need to read the database
   or files. You can hardcode book details for around 5 ISBNs and return them
   to the client as search results.
   
   For instance, you can return "C_Programming;K&R;Prentice Hall;200" 
   for ISBN = "102200111" (some random number)
   
2. The entire page will download in multiple stages. 
   The content will not come at once. (Why??).
   The text content (information about how to use the site) will load first.(Why??) 
   
3. You can provide a time gap of around 3 seconds before you download 
   the next content. You have to decide whether you will download the links
   or images (logo etc) or the search box with the button.
   
4. The hyperlinks (around 4 of them) will be links to library sites of 
   individual departments. (You can provide static html pages for each 
   of these links, each page displaying some default text)
   
5. After the entire download, the page looks as shown in the attached jpeg.

6. As you make the user wait for more content, you must have place holders
   (possibly <div> elements) which have a "gif" file to convey that more 
   information is coming. Use the attached gif file. As soon as the initial
   download is over, the gif will be placed in 3 places (for the images, the links
   and the search box)
   
7. Each download is accomplished by an AJAX call. Use XHR technique.
   The image can be downloaded using image-based AJAX.
   
8. The book search functionality is also asynchronous and the results are
   appended as an unordered list at the end of the current page. A new search
   will remove the current list and add a new one in its place.
   
9. The hyperlinks can be stored as a combination of innerHTML and hrefs in 
   a file on the server. 
   
   Ex:
   The file can be named links.text and can have the following content:
   CSE;http://www.cs.pes.edu
   ECE;http://www.ec.pes.edu
   EEE;http://www.eee.pesit.edu
   
   Now download the file entirely(without reading it on the server).
   When opening a connection using XHR, use the following line.
   
   xhr.open("GET", "http://localhost/links.txt",true);
   
   The xhr.responseText will have the entire file contents.
   
   Thus the files required to execute this exercise are:
   
   1) A client side HTML5 file (which has the initial content and also the
      AJAX code to do the Multi-stage download)
	  
   2) A text file on the server which has the hrefs' info (see point 9 above)
   
   3) A server side script to execute the search functionality.
   
   4) Images and the gif (see attached along with this instructions file)
   
   5) Static HTML pages for each of the hyperlinks.The exercise for the 2nd Program. This one is on Multi-stage download.

   2) A text file on the server which has the hrefs' info (see point 9 above)
   
   3) A server side script to execute the search functionality.
   
   4) Images and the gif (see attached along with this instructions file)
   
   5) Static HTML pages for each of the hyperlinks.The exercise for the 2nd Program. This one is on Multi-stage download.
(We will discuss in class in detail. The idea is straight-forward)

The problem statement is as follows.

A book-search web page served by localhost is rich in content and GUI. 
It has multiple images to display, a search form for the front-end user 
to search for a book, a set of links which might interest the user and 
also general information on how to use the site. Use Multi-stage download 
pattern to demonstrate good user experience with this page. On entering an 
ISBN in the search box and searching for it, return the matching book from the 
server. The server can maintain book information in a text file.

Notes:

1. When you search for the book for an ISBN, no need to read the database
   or files. You can hardcode book details for around 5 ISBNs and return them
   to the client as search results.
   
   For instance, you can return "C_Programming;K&R;Prentice Hall;200" 
   for ISBN = "102200111" (some random number)
   
2. The entire page will download in multiple stages. 
   The content will not come at once. (Why??).
   The text content (information about how to use the site) will load first.(Why??) 
   
3. You can provide a time gap of around 3 seconds before you download 
   the next content. You have to decide whether you will download the links
   or images (logo etc) or the search box with the button.
   
4. The hyperlinks (around 4 of them) will be links to library sites of 
   individual departments. (You can provide static html pages for each 
   of these links, each page displaying some default text)
   
5. After the entire download, the page looks as shown in the attached jpeg.

6. As you make the user wait for more content, you must have place holders
   (possibly <div> elements) which have a "gif" file to convey that more 
   information is coming. Use the attached gif file. As soon as the initial
   download is over, the gif will be placed in 3 places (for the images, the links
   and the search box)
   
7. Each download is accomplished by an AJAX call. Use XHR technique.
   The image can be downloaded using image-based AJAX.
   
8. The book search functionality is also asynchronous and the results are
   appended as an unordered list at the end of the current page. A new search
   will remove the current list and add a new one in its place.
   
9. The hyperlinks can be stored as a combination of innerHTML and hrefs in 
   a file on the server. 
   
   Ex:
   The file can be named links.text and can have the following content:
   CSE;http://www.cs.pes.edu
   ECE;http://www.ec.pes.edu
   EEE;http://www.eee.pesit.edu
   
   Now download the file entirely(without reading it on the server).
   When opening a connection using XHR, use the following line.
   
   xhr.open("GET", "http://localhost/links.txt",true);
   
   The xhr.responseText will have the entire file contents.
   
   Thus the files required to execute this exercise are:
   
   1) A client side HTML5 file (which has the initial content and also the
      AJAX code to do the Multi-stage download)
	  
   2) A text file on the server which has the hrefs' info (see point 9 above)
   
   3) A server side script to execute the search functionality.
   
   4) Images and the gif (see attached along with this instructions file)

   Now download the file entirely(without reading it on the server).
   When opening a connection using XHR, use the following line.
   
   xhr.open("GET", "http://localhost/links.txt",true);
   
   The xhr.responseText will have the entire file contents.
   
   Thus the files required to execute this exercise are:
   
   1) A client side HTML5 file (which has the initial content and also the
      AJAX code to do the Multi-stage download)
	  
   2) A text file on the server which has the hrefs' info (see point 9 above)
   
   3) A server side script to execute the search functionality.
   
   4) Images and the gif (see attached along with this instructions file)
   
   5) Static HTML pages for each of the hyperlinks.
   
   The exercise for the 2nd Program. This one is on Multi-stage download.
(We will discuss in class in detail. The idea is straight-forward)

The problem statement is as follows.

A book-search web page served by localhost is rich in content and GUI. 
It has multiple images to display, a search form for the front-end user 
to search for a book, a set of links which might interest the user and 
also general information on how to use the site. Use Multi-stage download 
pattern to demonstrate good user experience with this page. On entering an 
ISBN in the search box and searching for it, return the matching book from the 
server. The server can maintain book information in a text file.

Notes:

1. When you search for the book for an ISBN, no need to read the database
   or files. You can hardcode book details for around 5 ISBNs and return them
   to the client as search results.
   
   For instance, you can return "C_Programming;K&R;Prentice Hall;200" 
   for ISBN = "102200111" (some random number)
   
2. The entire page will download in multiple stages. 
   The content will not come at once. (Why??).
   The text content (information about how to use the site) will load first.(Why??) 
   
3. You can provide a time gap of around 3 seconds before you download 
   the next content. You have to decide whether you will download the links
   or images (logo etc) or the search box with the button.
   
4. The hyperlinks (around 4 of them) will be links to library sites of 
   individual departments. (You can provide static html pages for each 
   of these links, each page displaying some default text)
   
5. After the entire download, the page looks as shown in the attached jpeg.

6. As you make the user wait for more content, you must have place holders
   (possibly <div> elements) which have a "gif" file to convey that more 
   information is coming. Use the attached gif file. As soon as the initial
   download is over, the gif will be placed in 3 places (for the images, the links
   and the search box)
   
7. Each download is accomplished by an AJAX call. Use XHR technique.
   The image can be downloaded using image-based AJAX.
   
8. The book search functionality is also asynchronous and the results are
   appended as an unordered list at the end of the current page. A new search
   will remove the current list and add a new one in its place.
   
9. The hyperlinks can be stored as a combination of innerHTML and hrefs in 
   a file on the server. 
   
   Ex:
   The file can be named links.text and can have the following content:
   CSE;http://www.cs.pes.edu
   ECE;http://www.ec.pes.edu
   EEE;http://www.eee.pesit.edu
   
   Now download the file entirely(without reading it on the server).
   When opening a connection using XHR, use the following line.
   
   xhr.open("GET", "http://localhost/links.txt",true);

   appended as an unordered list at the end of the current page. A new search
   will remove the current list and add a new one in its place.
   
9. The hyperlinks can be stored as a combination of innerHTML and hrefs in 
   a file on the server. 
   
   Ex:
   The file can be named links.text and can have the following content:
   CSE;http://www.cs.pes.edu
   ECE;http://www.ec.pes.edu
   EEE;http://www.eee.pesit.edu
   
   Now download the file entirely(without reading it on the server).
   When opening a connection using XHR, use the following line.
   
   xhr.open("GET", "http://localhost/links.txt",true);
   
   The xhr.responseText will have the entire file contents.
   
   Thus the files required to execute this exercise are:
   
   1) A client side HTML5 file (which has the initial content and also the
      AJAX code to do the Multi-stage download)
	  
   2) A text file on the server which has the hrefs' info (see point 9 above)
   
   3) A server side script to execute the search functionality.
   
   4) Images and the gif (see attached along with this instructions file)
   
   5) Static HTML pages for each of the hyperlinks.
   
   
   The exercise for the 2nd Program. This one is on Multi-stage download.
(We will discuss in class in detail. The idea is straight-forward)

The problem statement is as follows.

A book-search web page served by localhost is rich in content and GUI. 
It has multiple images to display, a search form for the front-end user 
to search for a book, a set of links which might interest the user and 
also general information on how to use the site. Use Multi-stage download 
pattern to demonstrate good user experience with this page. On entering an 
ISBN in the search box and searching for it, return the matching book from the 
server. The server can maintain book information in a text file.

Notes:

1. When you search for the book for an ISBN, no need to read the database
   or files. You can hardcode book details for around 5 ISBNs and return them
   to the client as search results.
   
   For instance, you can return "C_Programming;K&R;Prentice Hall;200" 
   for ISBN = "102200111" (some random number)
   
2. The entire page will download in multiple stages. 
   The content will not come at once. (Why??).
   The text content (information about how to use the site) will load first.(Why??) 
   
3. You can provide a time gap of around 3 seconds before you download 
   the next content. You have to decide whether you will download the links
   or images (logo etc) or the search box with the button.
   
4. The hyperlinks (around 4 of them) will be links to library sites of 
   individual departments. (You can provide static html pages for each 
   of these links, each page displaying some default text)
   
5. After the entire download, the page looks as shown in the attached jpeg.

6. As you make the user wait for more content, you must have place holders
   (possibly <div> elements) which have a "gif" file to convey that more 
   information is coming. Use the attached gif file. As soon as the initial
   download is over, the gif will be placed in 3 places (for the images, the links
   and the search box)
   
7. Each download is accomplished by an AJAX call. Use XHR technique.
   The image can be downloaded using image-based AJAX.
   
8. The book search functionality is also asynchronous and the results are
   appended as an unordered list at the end of the current page. A new search
   will remove the current list and add a new one in its place.

6. As you make the user wait for more content, you must have place holders
   (possibly <div> elements) which have a "gif" file to convey that more 
   information is coming. Use the attached gif file. As soon as the initial
   download is over, the gif will be placed in 3 places (for the images, the links
   and the search box)
   
7. Each download is accomplished by an AJAX call. Use XHR technique.
   The image can be downloaded using image-based AJAX.
   
8. The book search functionality is also asynchronous and the results are
   appended as an unordered list at the end of the current page. A new search
   will remove the current list and add a new one in its place.
   
9. The hyperlinks can be stored as a combination of innerHTML and hrefs in 
   a file on the server. 
   
   Ex:
   The file can be named links.text and can have the following content:
   CSE;http://www.cs.pes.edu
   ECE;http://www.ec.pes.edu
   EEE;http://www.eee.pesit.edu
   
   Now download the file entirely(without reading it on the server).
   When opening a connection using XHR, use the following line.
   
   xhr.open("GET", "http://localhost/links.txt",true);
   
   The xhr.responseText will have the entire file contents.
   
   Thus the files required to execute this exercise are:
   
   1) A client side HTML5 file (which has the initial content and also the
      AJAX code to do the Multi-stage download)
	  
   2) A text file on the server which has the hrefs' info (see point 9 above)
   
   3) A server side script to execute the search functionality.
   
   4) Images and the gif (see attached along with this instructions file)
   
   5) Static HTML pages for each of the hyperlinks.
   
   The exercise for the 2nd Program. This one is on Multi-stage download.
(We will discuss in class in detail. The idea is straight-forward)

The problem statement is as follows.

A book-search web page served by localhost is rich in content and GUI. 
It has multiple images to display, a search form for the front-end user 
to search for a book, a set of links which might interest the user and 
also general information on how to use the site. Use Multi-stage download 
pattern to demonstrate good user experience with this page. On entering an 
ISBN in the search box and searching for it, return the matching book from the 
server. The server can maintain book information in a text file.

Notes:

1. When you search for the book for an ISBN, no need to read the database
   or files. You can hardcode book details for around 5 ISBNs and return them
   to the client as search results.
   
   For instance, you can return "C_Programming;K&R;Prentice Hall;200" 
   for ISBN = "102200111" (some random number)
   
2. The entire page will download in multiple stages. 
   The content will not come at once. (Why??).
   The text content (information about how to use the site) will load first.(Why??) 
   
3. You can provide a time gap of around 3 seconds before you download 
   the next content. You have to decide whether you will download the links
   or images (logo etc) or the search box with the button.
   
4. The hyperlinks (around 4 of them) will be links to library sites of 
   individual departments. (You can provide static html pages for each 
   of these links, each page displaying some default text)
   
5. After the entire download, the page looks as shown in the attached jpeg.

6. As you make the user wait for more content, you must have place holders

   The text content (information about how to use the site) will load first.(Why??) 
   
3. You can provide a time gap of around 3 seconds before you download 
   the next content. You have to decide whether you will download the links
   or images (logo etc) or the search box with the button.
   
4. The hyperlinks (around 4 of them) will be links to library sites of 
   individual departments. (You can provide static html pages for each 
   of these links, each page displaying some default text)
   
5. After the entire download, the page looks as shown in the attached jpeg.

6. As you make the user wait for more content, you must have place holders
   (possibly <div> elements) which have a "gif" file to convey that more 
   information is coming. Use the attached gif file. As soon as the initial
   download is over, the gif will be placed in 3 places (for the images, the links
   and the search box)
   
7. Each download is accomplished by an AJAX call. Use XHR technique.
   The image can be downloaded using image-based AJAX.
   
8. The book search functionality is also asynchronous and the results are
   appended as an unordered list at the end of the current page. A new search
   will remove the current list and add a new one in its place.
   
9. The hyperlinks can be stored as a combination of innerHTML and hrefs in 
   a file on the server. 
   
   Ex:
   The file can be named links.text and can have the following content:
   CSE;http://www.cs.pes.edu
   ECE;http://www.ec.pes.edu
   EEE;http://www.eee.pesit.edu
   
   Now download the file entirely(without reading it on the server).
   When opening a connection using XHR, use the following line.
   
   xhr.open("GET", "http://localhost/links.txt",true);
   
   The xhr.responseText will have the entire file contents.
   
   Thus the files required to execute this exercise are:
   
   1) A client side HTML5 file (which has the initial content and also the
      AJAX code to do the Multi-stage download)
	  
   2) A text file on the server which has the hrefs' info (see point 9 above)
   
   3) A server side script to execute the search functionality.
   
   4) Images and the gif (see attached along with this instructions file)
   
   5) Static HTML pages for each of the hyperlinks.
   
   
   The exercise for the 2nd Program. This one is on Multi-stage download.
(We will discuss in class in detail. The idea is straight-forward)

The problem statement is as follows.

A book-search web page served by localhost is rich in content and GUI. 
It has multiple images to display, a search form for the front-end user 
to search for a book, a set of links which might interest the user and 
also general information on how to use the site. Use Multi-stage download 
pattern to demonstrate good user experience with this page. On entering an 
ISBN in the search box and searching for it, return the matching book from the 
server. The server can maintain book information in a text file.

Notes:

1. When you search for the book for an ISBN, no need to read the database
   or files. You can hardcode book details for around 5 ISBNs and return them
   to the client as search results.
   
   For instance, you can return "C_Programming;K&R;Prentice Hall;200" 
   for ISBN = "102200111" (some random number)

   The content will not come at once. (Why??).
