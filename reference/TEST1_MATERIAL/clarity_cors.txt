CORS -- Cross-Origin-Resource-Sharing
=======================================================================

Simple request methods = GET, HEAD and POST (x-www-form-urlencoded, multipart/form-data, 
text/plain). These are not preflighted.
The browser blindly makes a request with the "origin" header field set to the ip address
of the client. The server responds with the "data" and also the Access-Control-Allow-Origin header. The browser compares the "origin" with this header
and if they match, the data is shown to the user. Otherwise, blocks it.


The other methods - PUT, DELETE and also POST with other content-types are preflighted
with the "OPTIONS" method. So too with custom-headers set in the request.
Browser sends the following headers (first line is the "kind of" request anyway)
OPTIONS http://somecrossdserver.com HTTP/1.1
Origin: ip address
Access-Control-Request-Method: POST (the method type to be used during the ACTUAL request)
Access-Control-Request-Headers: Content-type, X-SOME-OTHER

Server responds with whatever headers the code has set (plus default of its own)
Now the browser checks the "Access-Control-Allow-Origin", "Access-Control-Allow-Methods"
to make sure it "CAN" make the ACTUAL request.
